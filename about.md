Hey there! I am Vignesh Jayavel a.k.a Vikki, a passionate programmer from India.

I craft beautiful code at <a href="http://www.freshdesk.com" target="_blank">Freshdesk</a>, a leading SaaS product startup. 
My interests mostly revolve around distributed systems and scaling. Having said that, I should add that most of the code I write is serverside. But I don't take sides when it comes to programming. 
I am super-comfortable hacking full stack, right from user-facing UI to low level UNIX system administration.

> Coffee is mankind's greatest invention. Second is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biryani" target="_blank">Biryani</a>.

## Hobby

You can find me travelling in weekend trains to Bangalore and Hyderabad every now and then to attend conferences and hackathons. Hackathons are my favourite getaways. 

When I am not coding or mindlessly browsing, I usually delve into books and movies.
I usually go through croudsourced lists of books and readinglists of great people in tech-arena. 
I read some of them and I will try to list down some of my picks here.

> I like art in any form. I believe film-making is one of its divine forms.

I worship Stanley Kubrick and Akira Kurosawa. I am a sucker for Drama, War, Crime and Thriller types. 

## Experience

I am a Computer Science graduate from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_Engineering,_Guindy" target="_blank">College of Engineering Guindy</a>, Anna University, Chennai. <a href="http://www.oracle.com" target="_blank">Oracle</a> and <a href="http://www.trimble.com" target="_blank">Trimble</a> are some of the place that I have previously worked.
