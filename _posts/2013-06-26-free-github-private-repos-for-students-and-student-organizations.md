## Free GitHub Private Repos for Students and Student organizations

![Image](http://vikkiandtheweb.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/octocat_professor.png?w=222) GitHub is the world's largest source-code hosting service. It offers its service free of cost for developers to collaborate on their own projects and contribute to famous opensource projects with a limitation that the source-code hosted should be opensourced or  available publicly for anyone to use. Some developers working on their own proprietary software may be taken back by this restriction. They either tend to pay GitHub for their Premium service (that allows private repos) or move to BitBucket or GitLab (unlimited private repos) . I had a few projects that I need to collaborate with my fellow-coders without opening the code for the public. They were hosted at BitBucket. BitBucket is a nice service but it lacks the interactivity found in GitHub. I badly wanted private repos on GitHub, but could not afford to pay. I was very happy when GitHub recently announced that it will start offering private repositories for student and student-organizations. I just rushed to github.com/edu and requested them via mail. Initially I was disappointed to hear that I needed a valid email ID issued by my college ( Damn, my college doesn't give anything like that!! :P ) and later they were kind enough to accept anything that would prove my identity in my college. I scanned my college ID card and mailed them. Few days later, my github account was enabled with 5 Private repos!! Hurrah! :D
