## Improve your browsing experience with Smooth Scrolling in Google Chrome

The default scrolling behavior in Google Chrome is not so visually appealing. You can see the texts and images appearing jittery when you scroll up or down a webpage. Chrome does this  to minimize the CPU/GPU usage regardless of the powerful specs that your computer has. There is a neat little setting that enables the smooth scrolling effect and improve your browsing experience. 

  1. Open "chrome://flags/#enable-smooth-scrolling" in a new tab.
  2. Click "Enable".
  3. Restart Chrome.
NOTE: Some Chrome builds have this flag enabled by default. Tried and tested on 

Google Chrome
31.0.1650.63 (Official Build 238485) m

OS
Windows
