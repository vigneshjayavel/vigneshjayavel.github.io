## Deobfuscating Google.com - A little trick

Have you ever wanted to look into the JS source of the world's favorite search engine? Believe me, you 'll be mind boggled! The js is 99.99% not readable! Don't worry! Chrome devtools comes to the rescue. (You 'll need Chrome for this trick) Press ctrl+shift+i to open Chrome devtools In the sources tab , open the js file (or simply _Program_) and click on "**Pretty Print**" icon that you 'll find in toolbar at the bottom of Chrome devtools. This gives you nice human-readable js. This trick can be extended to pretty much any compressed or obfuscated js!
