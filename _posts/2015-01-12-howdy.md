Howdy!! ladies and gentleboys! Kickstarting my first blog post of 2015 with one of my favorite quotes from the movie Fight Club:

  > You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You're not your fucking khakis. You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world!!!.

Keep watching this space to catch all my musings. :) :P
