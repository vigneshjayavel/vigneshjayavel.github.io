## Bitbucket - Free Distributed Version Control System allowing unlimited private repos

[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)Â is a good alternative to the popular DVCS github. There are two good reasons to consider it as an alternative , 1\. It allows unlimited repos (projects) for free (Even github does that? and btw who needs all that??) 2.Unlike github , "_Private_" repos (Your source is closed and nobody can access it) are _free_ and also _unlimited_ (Up to 5 developers per repo are allowed for free) note: It supports git and mercurial vcs !
