## Google Apps Scripts - Automate Google Products With JS

Google Apps Script is a JavaScript cloud scripting language that provides easy ways to automate tasks across Google products and third party services. With Google Apps Script you can: 

  * **Automate repetitive processes and workflows.** Create scripts to automate expense approvals, time-sheet tracking, ticket management, order fulfillment, and much more.
  * **Link Google products with third party services.** A script can send custom emails and a calendar invitation to a list from a MySQL database.
  * **Create custom spreadsheet functions.** Apply customized formatting or do complex analysis on data in Google Spreadsheets.
  * **Build rich graphical user interfaces and menus.** With Google Apps Script, a company could power an internal application for purchasing office supplies, where users could shop via a customized menu interface.
